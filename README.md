# FogDb
## FogDb is a very simple to use NoSql document based database

FogDb (furthur referred to as just db) is a database made in java and is very simple to use.  
I was tired of all the existing databases have wierd me-only problems like, MongoDB is too complicated and can't be self hosted and meanwhile Firebase don't even have client side libraries for most languages including java.
