FogDb (furthur referred to as just db) is a database made in java for ease of data storage, high flexibility and very niche. I was tired of all the databases already existing, for example, MongoDB is too complicated and can't be self hosted and meanwhile Firebase don't even have client side libraries for most languages including java. 

## How to install: 
1. Complie the code in jar file and use but there's no use as it's currently unfinished.
